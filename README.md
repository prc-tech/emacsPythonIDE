# emacsPythonIDE
Setting up EMACS as python ide..Just simple none of the extremely nice setups, spacemacs, doom emacs or system crafters...

I will be be running through the instructions from the following web-site : https://realpython.com/emacs-the-best-python-editor/
This will include:

  - Install Emacs on your selected platform
  - Set up an Emacs initialization file to configure Emacs
  - Build a basic Python configuration for Emacs
  - Write Python code to explore Emacs capabilities
  - Run and Test Python code in the Emacs environment
  - Debug Python code using integrated Emacs tools
  - Add source control functionality using Git

I will be using EMACS VANILLA from https://emacsformacosx.com/ This will v29.1. I know there are other versions availible but this just seems to be a fuss free base with which to start from.
